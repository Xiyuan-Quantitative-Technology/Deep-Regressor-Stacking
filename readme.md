#deep regressor stacking to learn molecular quantum properties


In order to run the code, python packages including (but not limited) deepchem, pytorch, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib should be installed.

The program can generate the DRS result for both OE62 and QM9 datasets with DNN regressor.

OE62 input data can be obtained in: https://pan.baidu.com/s/17uQ4hm7hiJeqdEPIXgnHow
